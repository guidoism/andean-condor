48 key monoblock split keyboard

## Characteristics

- 3x6 core + 6 key thumb cluster per hand
- Pro-micro MCU footprint (note: it's right-side-up which apparently goes against the current trend)
- Nice!View headers (untested)

## Inspiration 

- Kyria -- A huge inpsiration, the thumb cluster in particular is taken directly from the Kyria
- Absolem -- Monoblock split and angles taken from Absolem

## Changes in version 3

- Move diodes to sit next to their switches to save space and use SMT to reduce size and holes
- Move reset switch away from usb plug
- Move Nice!View to its standard location just below the Nice!Nano
- Screw holes for MCU plate cover and seperate MCU plate cover with optional place for Nice!View
- Second PCB attached to top PCB to hide pointy through hole component stuff
- Holes in the PCB in a few places for magnets to hole keyboard inside case without screws
- Place to attach larger battery so it's not flopping around
- Place to connect battery to PCB rather than directly to Nice!Nano
- Place for 8x1 neopixels to indicate stuff? Maybe on plate cover?
- Place 7-segment display? Maybe on plate cover?
- Maybe plate cover has legs to break out pins?
